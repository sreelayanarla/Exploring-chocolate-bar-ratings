# Exploring-chocolate-bar-ratings
This project explores chocolate bar ratings from the Flavors of Cacao dataset. Using regression, clustering, and visualization in Tableau, it uncovers how cocoa content, time, and origin influence ratings, offering insights into consumer preferences and market strategy.
Chocolate Data Insights

In a world where culinary trends and consumer preferences are constantly evolving, chocolate remains a universally beloved indulgence. Understanding patterns in chocolate ratings, ingredients, and production origins can provide valuable insights for chocolatiers, retailers, and enthusiasts alike. This project analyzes chocolate data to uncover trends in flavor, quality, and global production.

Objective

This project generates actionable insights into chocolate quality and consumer preferences, highlighting patterns and disparities across chocolate types, cocoa origins, and ratings.

Key Questions

What makes chocolate highly rated? Explore the factors that contribute to chocolate quality, including cocoa percentage, ingredients, and bean origin.

Where are the flavor hotspots? Identify regions and countries producing the most acclaimed chocolates.

What patterns emerge in chocolate characteristics? Discover trends in cocoa content, flavor notes, and chocolate types.

Data

The analysis is based on a chocolate dataset encompassing information on chocolate bars, cocoa origins, ratings, and company details. The dataset allows both comparative analysis and trend exploration.

Dataset source:

Chocolate Data
 â€“ Kaggle

The dataset contains fields such as:

Company â€“ Chocolate manufacturer

Origin â€“ Cocoa origin country

Cocoa_Percent â€“ Cocoa content in percentage

Rating â€“ Consumer/critic rating (1â€“5)

Bean_Type â€“ Type of cocoa bean used

Broad_Bean_Type â€“ General bean category

Review â€“ Tasting notes

Tools

The analysis was performed using Python with the following libraries:

Pandas and NumPy â€“ data cleaning, wrangling, and analysis

Matplotlib and Seaborn â€“ statistical graphics and visualization

Plotly Express â€“ interactive visualizations

Scikit-learn and Statsmodels â€“ regression models, clustering, and trend analysis

OS and JSON â€“ file management and structured data handling

The visual storyboard and interactive dashboards were created using Tableau, enabling dynamic exploration of chocolate trends.
